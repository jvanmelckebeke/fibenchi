    **Delta compression:** After the initial full payload, only symbols whose
    data has changed since the previous push are included — reducing bandwidth
    when prices are stable or markets are closed.

    **Adaptive intervals:** The server adjusts the push frequency based on
    market state:
    - **15 s** during regular trading hours (`REGULAR`)
    - **60 s** during pre/post-market sessions
    - **300 s** when all markets are closed

    Each SSE event uses `event: quotes` with a JSON object keyed by symbol.

    **Intraday bars** arrive as a separate `event: intraday`, and only for the
    symbols named in the `intraday` param. Quotes are small and every page
    shows them; a full bar set is neither. To change the selection, reopen the
    stream with a different param — the new connection's first push carries
    the full window for the newly requested symbols.
