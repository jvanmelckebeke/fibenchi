"""Instrument — what a ticker's shape says about it, decided once.

The one-pass ``classify`` is the single place ticker characters are
interpreted. It decides *everything* the shape can tell — what kind of
instrument it is, which venue calendar governs it, how its price number
should be read, and its inferred currency — captured together in an
:class:`Instrument` so no later code
ever re-inspects the characters ("is this a future?" is
``ref.kind.is_future``, not another ``endswith`` somewhere).
