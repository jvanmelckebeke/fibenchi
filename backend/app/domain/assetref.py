    stored asset id: ``AssetRef("IWDA.AS").venue``, ``AssetRef.of(asset).id``.

    A ``str`` subclass, so it drops in anywhere a plain symbol string is
    used (dict keys, comparisons, serialization, provider calls) — equality
    and hashing are the ticker's, and ``id`` is metadata that never affects
    them. Note that str operations (``.upper()`` etc.) return plain ``str``
    — re-wrap if you still need the traits afterwards.

    Deliberately not the ORM ``Asset``: batch loops isolate per-symbol
    failures with rollbacks, and a rollback expires every live instance in
    the session — touching an expired attribute then raises
    ``MissingGreenlet`` (the 2026-08-05 hole-heal crash). An ``AssetRef``
    is captured once while the row is live (``AssetRef.of(asset)``) and is
    immune by construction.

    Venue resolution is cached on the instance; the Venue itself is shared
    per calendar. Ticker shape is only ever interpreted in
    ``app.domain.instrument.classify``.
