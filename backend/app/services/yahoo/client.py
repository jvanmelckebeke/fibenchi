"""Single client for all Yahoo Finance access.

Every Yahoo HTTP call in the codebase goes through :data:`yahoo_client`.
That gives us one place to apply the throttle (:mod:`rate_limit`),
quote/holdings caches, and the retry-once-with-fresh-session pattern.

Direct ``from yahooquery import Ticker`` imports anywhere else in the
codebase are a code smell — route the call through this client instead.

The client's behaviour is split across one mixin per concern
(``_quotes.py``, ``_history.py``, …) so each file stays small and
focused. They all reach the upstream library through :meth:`_ticker`,
which is the single place ``Ticker`` is instantiated — tests patch
``app.services.yahoo.client.Ticker`` to substitute the upstream library
across every operation in one shot.
