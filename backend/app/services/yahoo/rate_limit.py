"""Global rate limiter + circuit breaker for Yahoo Finance calls.

Yahoo's anti-bot detection treats coordinated bursts from a single IP as
scraping and responds with "Invalid Crumb" errors that effectively block
the IP for a while. Without coordination, the SSE quote stream, intraday
probe and scheduled refresh each fire their own bursts, compounding the
problem.

This module exposes the building blocks; the orchestration (retry,
fallback) lives in :class:`~app.services.yahoo.client.YahooClient._call`
so each Yahoo operation just wires its own ``fetch`` and ``fallback``.

Building blocks:

- :class:`YahooThrottle` — process-wide spacing + circuit breaker
- :data:`yahoo_throttle` — singleton instance used by ``YahooClient``
- :func:`crumb_rejected` — predicate on a Yahoo response dict
- :func:`check_crumb` — raises :class:`CrumbRejected` when the predicate fires
- :class:`CrumbRejected` — signal used inside fetch closures
